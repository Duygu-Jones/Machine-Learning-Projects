## Executive Summary:

- This project aims to predict car prices using the Auto Scout dataset from AutoScout24, containing features of 9 car models. 
- By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing machine learning models, the goal is to gain insights into the data and build effective regression models for car price prediction.
- Additionally, these models can support automotive industry stakeholders in understanding market trends, optimizing pricing strategies, and making data-driven decisions. Consumers can also benefit by making informed choices when selecting vehicles.
- Ultimately, the goal is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance the understanding of the automotive market, improve pricing accuracy, and support sustainable development in the automotive industry.

## Objectives

1. **Understand the dataset and its features.**
2. **Clean and prepare the data for modelling.**
3. **Implement various regression algorithms to predict car prices.**
4. **Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters and focusing on important features.**
5. **Compare the performance of different regression algorithms.**


*The dataset and results are used for educational purposes, demonstrating the application of advanced machine learning techniques on real-world data. We aim to build effective regression models to predict car prices and gain a deeper understanding of machine-learning techniques.*
